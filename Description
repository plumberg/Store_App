This app will track sales for a store. It includes the following features:
• Multiple users can have an account with the store. They login with a username and password.
• Users can look at the different items the store has for sale.
• Users can make purchases.
• Purchases can be of quantities greater than or equal to 1 for any item the store sells. You can force users to purchase separate items as separate purchases if you prefer.
• Purchases are not paid for at the time of purchase. Rather, the user's account reflects the charge. Users should not be allowed to make a purchase if they already owe more than a specific limit you specify in your code.
• Users can check their account balances and pay any amount (even more than what they owe).
• Users can check a list of all of their purchases, all of their purchases within a certain date range, and all of their purchases within a certain price range.
The application is backed by a SQL Server database.
